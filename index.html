    <h1>Welcome to My Research Website</h1>
    <p>On this Website I will go over a brief history of Artifical Intelligence</p>

            <p>Arthur Samuel was one of the first people to make a breakthrough in Artifical Intelligence. He managed to create a script to <i>play checkers.</i>In 1949 Samuel began his journey with his team. Infact once he began, he wasn't even writing a program for a machine that existed yet. His writing was on the IBM 701, also known as the defense calculator while in development. It was the first large non-numerical program, so it would dictate all subsequent IMB machines. Samuel wrote the checkers program as a set of small self-contained modules loaded by a central module. In the end of it all, his program reached an advanced amateur playing field for checkers. It was impressive for the time seeing as one man, Claude Shannon, wanted to make a program for Chess, which he failed at. Samuel completed his first checker program on the IBM 701, and when it was about to be demonstrated, Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the founder and president of IBM, said  that the demonstration of the program would raise the price of IBM stock by 15 points. Remarkably, it did. Samuel was eventually put in charge of a pure research effort after persuading the Watsons that IBM needed to do pure research and not just product development.</p>
